# Book-Reader-WPF
This WPF project is a book reader application which was designed and developed using XAML and C#.

****REQUIRED INFORMATION****
The source code was updated so that the text files for the books are now in a relative path to the entire project folder.

This should allow for easier execution of this application and its proper functionality.

Feel free to use, modify, and experiment as you want with this project!
