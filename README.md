# Book-Reader-WPF
This WPF project is a book reader application which was designed and developed using XAML and C#.

****REQUIRED INFORMATION****
Make sure to change the directory file-path(s) in the MainWindow.cs file to a path of your choosing whenever you see
the FileStream object being instantiated with a passed in string file-path to the class constructor.

Make sure to place the booktitle.txt files into this newly chosen directory path.

Otherwise, this application will not be able to access/read-in the necessary text files into text block/area.

Feel free to use, modify, and experiment as you want with this project!
